# Deferred work

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-2-supabase-roles-grants.md`
  summary: Stage 2: hosted Supabase does not run `supabase/roles.sql` automatically, so the four roles must exist before migration `20261010120000_register_and_app_schemas.sql` runs there, or its `GRANT … TO reader` statements fail.
  evidence: The local CLI applies `roles.sql` on `db start` and `db reset` ("Seeding globals from roles.sql"). `supabase db push` does so only with `--include-roles` ("Include custom roles from supabase/roles.sql", verified in CLI 2.120.0 `db push --help`); otherwise the roles must be created another way before the push.
